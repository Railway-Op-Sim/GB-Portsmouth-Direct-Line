# Portsmouth Direct Line

## History

### Construction

The Portsmouth Direct Line is the route between Woking and Portsmouth Harbour, through the South Downs in southern England. Services along the line run from the London terminus "Waterloo", along the South Western Main Line to Woking. 

The line was opened in stages by the Portsmouth Railway, in an effort to create a more direct route to the important naval town of Portsmouth than those of the already established companies in the area - the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) via Basingstoke, and the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) via Horsham.

Construction started at the north end, with Woking to Guildford being the first section to open in 1845, built by the Guildford Junction railway with the backing of the LSWR. Meanwhile at the southern end, the Brighton and Chichester Railway extended their line from Chichester to Portsmouth, with support from the London and Brighton Railway.

In 1846 the LBSCR was formed and acquired the Brighton and Chichester Railway, opening the line into Portsmouth in 1847. This line connected to the LSWR route via Basingstoke and Fareham in a triangle junction at Farlington.

The next section to open was from Guildford to Godalming by the LSWR in October 1849, although the tunnel at Guildford collapsed several times that year. Eventually in 1853 the direct route was authorised for the Portsmouth Railway, running from just north of the original terminus in Godalming to Havant. Both the LSWR and LBSCR were opposed to the scheme as it would be in direct competition with their own routes. Eventually in 1858 the LSWR agreed to lease the direct route from the Portsmouth Railway, and the route eventually opened in 1859.

However, th relationship between the LSWR and LBSCR worsened, partuclarly in relation to line-sharing agreements such as those in the Portsmouth area, leading the LSWR to consider building their own route onto Portsea island. Action culminated in 1858 with the LBSCR disconnecting the Portsmouth Railway's track at Havant, while the LSWR brought a train into the station blocking both lines.

When the Portsmouth Line did eventually open, LSWR still didn't have rights to run over the LBSCR route through Havant, resulting in services terminating at a temporary station nearby. In August 1859 a through-running agreement was finally reached, incorporating a pooling arrangement for pasenger fares and a rental use for the now joint line. 

### Doubling

While the line originally opened as a mainly single track route, it was steadily doubled between 1875 and 1878. This primarily took place in stages working from north to south, although the last section to be doubled was Liss to Rowlands Castle, with the line south thereof having been doubled a year earlier.

### F2P

Between early 2022 and late 2025, Network Rail started a major programme of works and upgrades on the Portsmouth Direct Line between Farncombe and Petersfield. These upgrades were referred to as "Farncombe to Petersfield", or F2P.

A major aspect of the upgrades were converting the line from predominantly 3-aspect signals to all 4-aspect, with the addition of extra signal sections to improve headways. As part of the resignalling, the remaining signal boxes at Farncombe, Haslemere and Petersfield were decommissioned in October 2025, with control transferring to a new panel at Basingstoke Rail Operating Centre (ROC). The box at Petersfield is being retained for training and equipment and the Haslemere box is planned to be converted into a museum by the local community, while Farncombe box has been demolished to make space for the upgraded level crossing.

Another aspect of the upgrades was replacement of the existing Automatic Half Barrier (AHB) crossings with manually controlled barrier with obstacle detector (MCB-OD) crossings, which has resulted in extended barrier down times in exchange for additional safety.

As part of the works some speed upgrades have been implemented, particularly in the Haslemere area to enable faster access to and from the loop.

## About the RailOS Project

This project is 2 in 1 - the first representing the Portsmouth Direct Line between Farncombe and Rowlands Castle as it was in 2021, and the other the upgraded route across the same section set in November 2025, immediately following completion of the F2P programme.

The 2021 route is an update to the previous version released in 2021. This includes correcting mistakes that have subsequently been discovered in the signalling, as well as updating the text across the simulation for increased clarity.

## Simulation

All services on the Portsmouth Direct Line are operated by South Western Railway, except for occasional ECS moves by CrossCountry between Eastleigh and Reading to retain route knowledge for diversions.

### 2021

A weekday timetable for Wednesday 12th May 2021 is included, with a standard off-peak service as follows:

- 2tph London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour (Fast)
- 1tph London Waterloo to Portsmouth & Southsea (Semi-Fast)
- 1tph London Waterloo to Haslemere (Slow)

Intervals between services are somewhat irregular due to the nature of the timetable following the Covid Pandemic, where trains were removed from the timetable to reduce frequencies without rebalancing the remaining services.

This is the same timetable as was included in the original version of the route. Warnings are included for entering southbound trains due to the close proximity of the level crossings at Farncombe.

### 2025

Two timetables are included for 2025.

#### Weekday - 17 November 2025

This timetable represents a standard Monday service on the 17th November 2025. Some RHTT and NR test trains are incorporated. Additionally, the final few services are amended to terminate early at Haslemere and return north.

The standard off peak service is as follows:

- 1tph London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour (Fast)
- 1tph London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour (Semi-Fast)
- 1tph London Waterloo to Haslemere (Slow)

During the peaks, services operate a broadly the following frequencies:
- 2tph London Waterloo to Portsmouth Harbour (Fast)
- 2tph London Waterloo to Portsmouth & Southsea (Slow)

Some trains throughout the day operate to/from Southampton Central and Fareham instead of Portsmouth.

#### Saturday Engineering Works - 15 November 2025

This timetable represents the 17th November 2025, where the line between Haslemere and Guildford is closed for some final commissioning of the F2P project. A shuttle service operates between Haslemere and Portsmouth.

- 1tph Haslemere to Portsmouth & Southsea (Slow)
- 1tph Haslemere to Portsmouth Harbour (Fast)

## Operational Tips

- All services include a platform for Haslemere in their descriptions. Sticking to these platforms should avoid any delays.
- Keep an eye on departure times from Haslemere, as trains often overtake here, particularly during peak hours.
- Be careful with the RHTT and Test trains, as these often make strange moves to keep out the way of the passenger services.
- Some trains will end up waiting at red signals behind others, but will be able to stick to time. In real life these have pathing allowances added, however the simulation does not incorporate these.
- Try to set routes across the level crossings early enough to not disrupt the service, but not too early or you'll be penalised for blocking traffic.
